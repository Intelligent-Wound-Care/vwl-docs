If you want to attach a person to a certain webinar or event as its presentor you will first have to create the person. This is also where you will add bandaging angels and other staff to display on the site.

### Creating People

A person requires :

- **Name**
- **Image**

Optional information includes :

- **Description**

Here is an example of a person card displaying the image, name, qualifications and location/vet group:

### Attaching Relations

Once a Person is created or when **Viewing** a Person you can attach additional information.

#### Person Type

This is where you can assign a type to a person, currently there are types for each bandaging angel and specialist sector. Attaching the relevant type to a person will make them appear on relevant pages.
